:::tip[**gRPC** tl;dr]

-   **High performance** framework that uses **protobuf** to define contracts and generate server and client code.
-   Use it when building **low latency**, **distributed**, **interoperable** and **highly scalable** systems.
-   Supports **bi-directional streaming** and **authentication** utilizing **HTTP/2**.

## What is gRPC?

gRPC (**g**RPC **R**emote **P**rocedure **C**all) is a highly performant, modern, open-source RPC framework under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) umberella, created by Google.<br/>

## How does gRPC work?

![gRPC flow](../../../../assets/gRPC/gRPC.png)

Using protocol buffers( proto files containing definitions of data structures) to generate both client and server across multiple supported languages.

-   utilizing http/2
-   bi-directional communication
-   interoperability
-   authorization
-   deadlines and timeouts
-   streaming
-   blocking and non-blocking calls

## When to use it?

Consider using when building systems that should:

-   provide low latency
-   be distributed
-   be highly scalable
-   using multiple languages / technologies
