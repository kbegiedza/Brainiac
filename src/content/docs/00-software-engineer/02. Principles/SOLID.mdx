SOLID is mnemonic for group of good practices related with object oriented programming.

- **S**ingle responsibility principle
- **O**pen-closed principle
- **L**iskov's substitution principle
- **I**nterface segregation principle
- **D**ependency inversion principle

### Single responsibility principle

Class should be responsible for one and only function.

### Open-closed principle

Class should be open for extension and closed for modification.

### Liskov's substitution principle

All subclasses should be compatible with contract defined by superclass.

### Interface segregation principle

Component should provide minimal required public interface.

### Dependency inversion principle

Components should depend on abstraction instead of concrete implementation.
