Relational databases consists of tables.
Each table is built from rows and columns.
Database Management System (DBMS) handles physical aspects of database.

## Indexing

- Clustered index - index that changes how table is stored.
- Non-clustered index - index that created separate data structure.
- Unique index - enforces uniqueness on values of indexed column(s).
- Full-text index - Allows fast full-text search.

### Replication

Replication is a process of synchronization between multiple instances (replicas) of database.

#### Partitioning

Split database into partitions.

#### Sharding

Split data inside database into shards.

#### Denormalization

Process of increasing duplication of data in relational databases in order to simplify and optimize queries by reducing required joins.
