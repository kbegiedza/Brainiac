## ACID

- **A**tomicity - operations are executed in 'all or nothing' manner.
- **C**onsistency - read operations always returns latest state of database.
- **I**solation - concurrent operations will yield the same results like ones executed sequentially.
- **D**urability - committed operations (and data) are stored persistently.

## Database types

- Relational (SQL)
- Non-relational (NoSQL)
  - Key-value (Redis, etcd)
  - Document (MongoDB, CouchDB)
  - Multi-model (CosmosDB)
  - Wide-column (BigTable, Cassandra)

## Consistency types

- Strong consistency - all nodes contains the same data at the same time
- Weak consistency - nodes might have different data at the same time.  
  Changes are propagated to all nodes in background.
