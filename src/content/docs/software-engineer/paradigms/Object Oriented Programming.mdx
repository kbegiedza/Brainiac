Object Oriented Programming OOP is programming paradigm based on concept of mapping real world objects to programming objects based on four principles:

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

### Abstraction

Abstraction principle means that every object should hide unnecessary details and expose only required, minimal interface to interact with.

```csharp
public abstract class Monster
{
    public abstract void GetDamage(int value);
}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation principle relay on hiding internal state of concrete object by utilizing, for example access modifiers.

::::note[Most commonly used access modifiers]
- public - accessible by everyone
- private - accessible only by containing class
- protected - accessible by containing and derived classes
::::

```csharp
public abstract class Monster
{
    private readonly int _maxHealth;

    private int _health;

    public abstract void GetDamage(int value);

    public int Health
    {
        get
        {
            //...
        }
        protected set
        {
            //...
        }
      }
}
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance principle means ability to extend functionality of previously defined objects.

```csharp
public class Dragon : Monster
{
    public override GetDamage(int value)
    {
        //...
    }
}

public class Hydra : Monster
{
    public override GetDamage(int value)
    {
        //...
    }
}
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism principle means ability to refer to object by sub-objects.

```csharp
var monsters = new List<Monster>
{
    new Hydra("Hydra"),
    new Dragon("Lord")
};

foreach (var monster in monsters)
{
    monster.GetDamage(42);

    //...
}
```
